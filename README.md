# DiplomskiCutura

This work uses Zivid Camera together with Zivid Library,Yaskawa CSDA-10F Robot, PCL Library.

*******************Localization*******************
This Code uses PCL Examples from https://pcl.readthedocs.io/projects/tutorials/en/master/(April 2022)
Including:
Title: How to use iterative closest point algorithm

Author: Gabe Oâ€™Leary

Compatibility: > PCL 1.0
,
Title: Plane model segmentation

Author: Radu B. Rusu

Compatibility: > PCL 1.3

In this tutorial, we will learn how to segment arbitrary plane models from a given point cloud dataset.
,
Title: The PCL Recognition API

Author: Tommaso Cavallari, Federico Tombari

Compatibility: > PCL 1.6

This tutorial aims at explaining how to perform 3D Object Recognition based on the pcl_recognition module.

,

Title: Hypothesis Verification for 3D Object Recognition

Author: Daniele De Gregorio, Federico Tombari

Compatibility: > PCL 1.7

This tutorial aims at explaining how to do 3D object recognition in clutter by verifying model hypotheses in cluttered and heavily occluded 3D scenes.

,
Title: Removing sparse outliers using StatisticalOutlierRemoval

Author: Radu B. Rusu

Compatibility: > PCL 1.0

In this tutorial, we will learn how to remove sparse outliers from noisy data, using StatisticalRemoval.

And others. Thank you for the afformention Examples, this work wouldn't be possible without them.

Zivid part comes from the Examples Supplied by the Zivid Company and modifying the afformentioned using their C++ and Python Libraries.

*******************Robot*******************
Yaskawa code was made using Motoplus C library.
